# Description
This project is a console based text/adventure game written in Java.
The player chooses a character to play as, then must navigate through different scenes (story arcs) while keeping track of their health, stamina, and items.

The purpose of this game is to show how the following can be accomplished using basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Manage data through objects
- Handle user input (from keyboard)
- Simulate random events

# Features
- Text-based interactive story
- Multiple scenes with branching choices
- Inventory system containing items that can be used
- Health and Stamina Tracking
